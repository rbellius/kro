                        Provides a list of client IDs, also known as audiences. When a mobile or
                        web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value
                        that identifies the application. This is the value that's sent as the client_id
                        parameter on OAuth requests.


                        You can register multiple client IDs with the same provider. For example,
                        you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC provider. You
                        cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single IAM OIDC provider.


                        There is no defined format for a client ID. The CreateOpenIDConnectProviderRequest
                        operation accepts client IDs up to 255 characters long.

                        A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity
                        provider's server certificates. Typically this list includes only one entry.
                        However, IAM lets you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This
                        lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating
                        certificates.


                        The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of
                        the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider
                        makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string.


                        You must provide at least one thumbprint when creating an IAM OIDC provider.
                        For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com and the
                        provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect.
                        In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value
                        of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.


                        For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider thumbprint, see Obtaining
                        the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect provider (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/identity-providers-oidc-obtain-thumbprint.html)

                        correspond to the iss claim in the provider's OpenID Connect ID tokens. Per
                        the OIDC standard, path components are allowed but query parameters are not.
                        Typically the URL consists of only a hostname, like https://server.example.org
                        or https://example.com. The URL should not contain a port number.


                        You cannot register the same provider multiple times in a single Amazon Web
                        Services account. If you try to submit a URL that has already been used for

                        The policy description is immutable. After a value is assigned, it cannot
                        be changed.

                        IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account.
                        Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources

                        This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash
                        (/).


                        This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex))
                        a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself
                        or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
                        can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character
                        (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased
                        letters.

                        policy.


                        You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation
                        templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format.
                        CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting
                        it to IAM.


                        The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation,
                        including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts
                        of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see IAM and STS character quotas
                        (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length).


                        To learn more about JSON policy grammar, see Grammar of the IAM JSON policy
                        language (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_grammar.html)

                        The regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this
                        parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:


                          * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\u0020)
                          through the end of the ASCII character range


                          * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character
                          set (through \u00FF)


                          * The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage
                          return (\u000D)

                    Contains information about an IAM role. This structure is returned as a response

                        The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permission to
                        assume the role.


                        In IAM, you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to a string.
                        However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide
                        the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML
                        policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.


                        The regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this
                        parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:


                          * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\u0020)
                          through the end of the ASCII character range


                          * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character
                          set (through \u00FF)


                          * The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage
                          return (\u000D)


                        Upon success, the response includes the same trust policy in JSON format.

                        one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.


                        Anyone who assumes the role from the CLI or API can use the DurationSeconds
                        API parameter or the duration-seconds CLI parameter to request a longer session.
                        The MaxSessionDuration setting determines the maximum duration that can be
                        requested using the DurationSeconds parameter. If users don't specify a value
                        for the DurationSeconds parameter, their security credentials are valid for
                        one hour by default. This applies when you use the AssumeRole* API operations
                        or the assume-role* CLI operations but does not apply when you use those
                        operations to create a console URL. For more information, see Using IAM roles

                        IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account.
                        Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources
                        named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

                        can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character
                        (\u007F), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased

                        A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that identity-based
                        policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions. Permissions
                        boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a resource-based policy
                        can grant to an entity. To learn more, see Permissions boundaries for IAM

                        A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that identity-based

                        boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a resource-based policy

                        The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format (http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601),
                        when the user was created.

                        The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format (http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601),
                        when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services
                        website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's
                        last sign-in time, see the Credential reports (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html)
                        topic in the IAM User Guide. If a password is used more than once in a five-minute
                        span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null
                        (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password.
                        This can be because:


                          * The user never had a password.


                          * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this
                          information on October 20, 2014.


                        A null value does not mean that the user never had a password. Also, if the
                        user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this
                        field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.


                        This value is returned only in the GetUser and ListUsers operations.
